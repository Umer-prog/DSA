# Tree Implementations in Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)

Welcome to my repository of tree implementations for my university DSA course! Here, you'll find various types of tree structures coded in c++. These are useful for anyone learning about data structures or looking to understand trees better.

- Binary Tree
- Binary Search Tree (BST)
- AVL Tree
- N-arry tree
- Expression Tree
- Double Tree (problem)
